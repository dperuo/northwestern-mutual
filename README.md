# Code Challenge for Northwestern Mutual

The web application you would be working on is built using .NET C# MVC application with Backbone.js. We are currently re-platforming the web application to be multiple single page applications using react.js/flux and connecting to Node.js services to replace a portion of the middleware. Please use the below test to show off your skill set and what you can bring to the team. If you are more UX/designed focused (HTML/CSS), it is OK to show off your page design skills. If you are a JavaScript guru, then wow us with your JavaScript.

Your code test will be evaluated on the following items:

1. Quality
2. Completeness
3. Creativity/Personalization
4. Technologies

Code Test:

- Create a search page that displays the returned results alphabetically.
- Use a HTML5, CSS3 responsive two-column layout with a header and footer.
- Execute an AJAX call for the search to an open source API and display the results.

Now is the time to show off your skills, creativity and passion for front end.

When you complete the coding exercise, you can place it in your public repository (github, bitbucket, dropbox).

Northwestern Mutual will review the solution and if weâ€™d like to proceed we will set up an interview to discuss the solution and go more in-depth into the job.

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
2. Update Protractor's Selenium server using `webdriver-manager update`.
3. Launch Vagrant with `vagrant up`.
4. Visit `localhost:8080` from your favorite browser to view the app.
5. Edit this repo in your favorite editor. Changes are pushed to the Vagrant server automatically.

- Rebuild JavaScript using `npm run build:js`.
- Rebuild CSS using `npm un build:scss`.
- Rebuild JavaScript and CSS using `npm run build`.
